	abstract = {Understanding species-habitat associations is fundamental to ecological sciences and for species conservation. Consequently, various statistical approaches have been designed to infer species-habitat associations. Due to their conceptual and mathematical differences, these methods can yield contrasting results. In this paper, we describe and compare commonly used statistical models that relate animal movement data to environmental data. Specifically, we examined selection functions which include resource selection function (RSF) and step-selection function (SSF), as well as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and related methods such as state-space models. We demonstrate differences in assumptions while highlighting advantages and limitations of each method. Additionally, we provide guidance on selecting the most appropriate statistical method based on the scale of the data and intended inference. To illustrate the varying ecological insights derived from each statistical model, we apply them to the movement track of a single ringed seal (Pusa hispida) in a case study. Through our case study, we demonstrate that each model yields varying ecological insights. For example, while the selection coefficient values from RSFs appear to show a stronger positive relationship with prey diversity than those of the SSFs, when we accounted for the autocorrelation in the data none of these relationships with prey diversity were statistically significant. Furthermore, the HMM reveals variable associations with prey diversity across different behaviors, for example, a positive relationship between prey diversity and a slow-movement behaviour. Notably, the three models identified different “important” areas. This case study highlights the critical significance of selecting the appropriate model as an essential step in the process of identifying species-habitat relationships and specific areas of importance. Our comprehensive review provides the foundational information required for making informed decisions when choosing the most suitable statistical methods to address specific questions, such as identifying expansive corridors or protected zones, understanding movement patterns, or studying behaviours. In addition, this study informs researchers with the necessary tools to apply these methods effectively.},

	abstract = {Wildlife telemetry data may be used to answer a diverse range of questions relevant to wildlife ecology and management. One challenge to modeling telemetry data is that animal movement often varies greatly in pattern over time, and current continuous-time modeling approaches to handle such nonstationarity require bespoke and often complex models that may pose barriers to practitioner implementation. We demonstrate a novel application of treed Gaussian process (TGP) modeling, a Bayesian machine learning approach that automatically captures the nonstationarity and abrupt transitions present in animal movement. The machine learning formulation of TGPs enables modeling to be nearly automated, while their Bayesian formulation allows for the derivation of movement descriptors with associated uncertainty measures. We demonstrate the use of an existing R package to implement TGPs using the familiar Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We then use estimated movement trajectories to derive movement descriptors that can be compared across individuals and populations. We applied the TGP model to a case study of lesser prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) to demonstrate the benefits of TGP modeling and compared distance traveled and residence times across lesser prairie-chicken individuals and populations. For broad usability, we outline all steps necessary for practitioners to specify relevant movement descriptors (e.g., turn angles, speed, contact points) and apply TGP modeling and trajectory comparison to their own telemetry datasets. Combining the predictive power of machine learning and the statistical inference of Bayesian methods to model movement trajectories allows for the estimation of statistically comparable movement descriptors from telemetry studies. Our use of an accessible R package allows practitioners to model trajectories and estimate movement descriptors, facilitating the use of telemetry data to answer applied management questions.},

	abstract = {Fields studying animal movement are data-starved due to large monetary and time costs of data collection, and, moreover, not all quantities of interest can be measured. Despite limited data, diverse models have been developed to study animal movement. Many of these models are based on random walks that use Gaussian noise. Examinations of real movement data show that the assumptions made in these models are not always valid on all spatial and time scales, and these shortcomings suggest that new models may be needed. We provide methods for developing and training more realistic models, specifically agent-based models of animal movement, by taking a data-driven approach. We took an exploratory data analysis (EDA) approach that allowed us to develop a model that best reproduced the movement patterns we observed in a real dataset of animal locations. In our EDA, we examined distributions of positions, calculated the autocorrelation of the movement data, used Fourier analysis, calculated mean-squared displacements, and tested for correlations. We introduce the fused-lasso regression-analysis method for identifying large and sudden changes in position through a non-parametric fit that is sensitive to discontinuities. We introduce the copula and kernel-density estimates as methods for approximating coordinate-system-independent movement correlations from the marginal location differences represented in our data set; use of the copula allows us to create correlated, non-Gaussian noise. With the insights gained from our EDA, we created a Langevin model that describes the movements of an individual animal, features non-Gaussian noise and incorporates multiple movement patterns. We extended this model to an agent-based model that describes the movements of several groups of deer. We compared our Langevin model to three models built on different assumptions that result in substantial differences in the area covered by an animal. Using our agent-based model, we simulated three groups of deer with parameters sampled from our data to illustrate the amount of area covered by deer in our model and the ability of groups to overlap in space. This overlapping behavior is an important feature of models of processes driven by interactions between animals, such as infectious diseases; our model could be useful for studying the spread of infectious diseases in animal populations, such as chronic wasting disease. While we have applied our data-driven methods to animal movement, these methods are widely applicable to developing and training models using a wide range of data sources.},

	abstract = {Highly evolved animals continuously update their knowledge of social factors, refining movement decisions based on both historical and real-time observations. Despite its significance, research on the underlying mechanisms remains limited. In this study, we explore how the use of explicit memory shapes different mathematical models across various ecological dispersal scenarios. Specifically, we investigate three memory-based dispersal scenarios: gradient-based movement, where individuals respond to environmental gradients; environment matching, which promotes uniform distribution within a population; and location-based movement, where decisions rely solely on local suitability. These scenarios correspond to diffusion advection, Fickian diffusion, and Fokker-Planck diffusion models, respectively. We focus on the derivation of these memory-based movement models using three approaches: spatial and temporal discretization, patch models in continuous time, and discrete-velocity jump process. These derivations highlight how different ways of using memory lead to distinct mathematical models. Numerical simulations reveal that the three dispersal scenarios exhibit distinct behaviors under memory-induced repulsive and attractive conditions. The diffusion advection and Fokker-Planck models display wiggle patterns and aggregation phenomena, while simulations of the Fickian diffusion model consistently stabilize to uniform constant states.},

	abstract = {Due to the substantial progress in tracking technology, recent years have seen an explosion in the amount of movement data being collected. This has led to a huge demand for statistical tools that allow ecologists to draw meaningful inference from large tracking data sets. The class of hidden Markov models (HMMs) matches the intuitive understanding that animal movement is driven by underlying behavioural modes and has proven to be very useful for analysing movement data. For data that involve a regular sampling unit and negligible measurement error, these models usually are sufficiently flexible to capture the complex correlation structure found in movement data, yet are computationally inexpensive compared to alternative methods. The R package moveHMM allows ecologists to process GPS tracking data into series of step lengths and turning angles, and to fit an HMM to these data, allowing, in particular, for the incorporation of environmental covariates. The package includes assessment and visualization tools for the fitted model. We illustrate the use of moveHMM using (simulated) movement of the legendary wild haggis Haggis scoticus. Our findings illustrate the role our software, and movement modelling in general, can play in conservation and management by illuminating environmental constraints.},

Habitat-selection analyses that incorporate movement characteristics, referred to as integrated step-selection analyses, are particularly appealing because they allow modelling of both movement and habitat-selection processes. Despite their popularity, many users struggle with interpreting parameters in habitat-selection and step-selection functions. Integrated step-selection analyses also require several additional steps to translate model parameters into a full-fledged movement model, and the mathematics supporting this approach can be challenging for many to understand. Using simple examples, we demonstrate how weighted distribution theory and the inhomogeneous Poisson point process can facilitate parameter interpretation in habitat-selection analyses. Furthermore, we provide a ‘how to’ guide illustrating the steps required to implement integrated step-selection analyses using the amt package By providing clear examples with open-source code, we hope to make habitat-selection analyses more understandable and accessible to end users.},

	abstract = {Advances in tracking technology have led to an exponential increase in animal location data, greatly enhancing our ability to address interesting questions in movement ecology, but also presenting new challenges related to data management and analysis. Step-selection functions (SSFs) are commonly used to link environmental covariates to animal location data collected at fine temporal resolution. SSFs are estimated by comparing observed steps connecting successive animal locations to random steps, using a likelihood equivalent of a Cox proportional hazards model. By using common statistical distributions to model step length and turn angle distributions, and including habitat- and movement-related covariates (functions of distances between points, angular deviations), it is possible to make inference regarding habitat selection and movement processes or to control one process while investigating the other. The fitted model can also be used to estimate utilization distributions and mechanistic home ranges. Here, we present the R package amt (animal movement tools) that allows users to fit SSFs to data and to simulate space use of animals from fitted models. The amt package also provides tools for managing telemetry data. Using fisher (Pekania pennanti) data as a case study, we illustrate a four-step approach to the analysis of animal movement data, consisting of data management, exploratory data analysis, fitting of models, and simulating from fitted models.},
