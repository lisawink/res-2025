   abstract = {Population dynamics are driven by stochastic and density-dependent processes acting on demographic rates. Individuals differ demographically, and to capture these differences, models of population dynamics are usually structured by age and stage, rarely by sex. An effect of sex on population dynamics is expected if the dynamics of males and females differ, requiring an unequal sex ratio at birth and/or sex-specific survival probabilities. Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) show large sexual size dimorphism and differential survival, but it is unknown whether males and females contribute differently to population dynamics. We studied a goshawk population in northern Germany over 47 years using brood monitoring data, collected feathers and nestling ringing data. We jointly analyzed the data using a two-sex integrated population model and performed retrospective and prospective population analyses to understand whether the demographic drivers of population change differ between the sexes. The population showed large fluctuations, during which the number of breeding pairs doubled, but the long-term trend of the population was slightly negative. Female survival exceeded male survival during the first year of life. Females started to reproduce at a younger age than males, productivity increased with female age, the sex ratio of nestlings was male biased and there was moderate male immigration. Despite these differences, temporal variation in sex ratio did not contribute to population dynamics and the contribution of temporal variation in survival was similar for both sexes. Variation in first-year survival was the strongest driver in this population, regulated by a weak density-dependent feedback acting through female first-year survival. Overall, the contributions of the two sexes to population dynamics were similar in this monogamous species with strong sexual size dimorphism.},

We review the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Red List to examine the conservation status, distributions, threats, and conservation recommendations for all 557 raptor species. We further assess the significance of Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) for raptor conservation. We also determine which countries contain the most species listed under the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Birds of Prey in Africa and Eurasia (Raptors MoU). Raptors, especially Old World vultures, are more threatened than birds in general. Eighteen percent of raptors are threatened with extinction and 52% of raptors have declining global populations. South and Southeast Asia have the highest richness and the largest number of threatened raptor species. By country, Indonesia has the highest richness of raptor species (119) and most declining species (63). China and Russia contain the most Raptors MoU species, although they are not yet signatories to the agreement. Raptor species that require forest are more likely to be threatened and declining than those that do not. Agriculture and logging are the most frequently identified threats, although poisoning is especially detrimental to Old World vultures. Of the 10 most important IBAs for raptors, six are in Nepal. Highest priority conservation actions to protect raptors include preventing mortality and conserving key sites and priority habitats. Improved long-term monitoring would allow for conservation to be appropriately targeted and effectiveness of interventions to be assessed.},

   abstract = {In communication animals use a full range of signals: acoustic, visual, chemical, electrical and tactile. The processes involved in how and why animals communicate have long held veritable fascination for scientists. A branch of science concerned with the production of sound and its effects on living organisms is bioacoustics. The main purpose of the present study is to raise and discuss some issues related to the relationship between animals, their sounds and ecology, including presentation of methods of analysis of sound recordings. A better understanding of the relationship between the studied animals will allow for development of a better framework for future research, as well as a better grasp of interactions between different organisms, including humans. The paper discusses the significance of acoustic research in animal ecology and its possible applications in the future. The author also summarizes previous research in the field of sound communication of various animal species. The paper proves that vocalizations of every acoustically communicating animal are threatened by climate change. For marine animals, the source of changes in vocalization abilities is ocean acidification and increased ambient noise, which can affect communication and foraging behavior. For terrestrial animals, changes in precipitation and temperature may result in modifications of the sounds emitted, as well as certain modifications to the auditory system. Together with changes in species distribution due to environmental parameters, cumulatively these factors can cause changes in the entire landscape of acoustics ecosystems. Thanks to acoustic biomonitoring, we can understand how the sounds of entire habitats and acoustic ecosystems will change in response to the changing climate and how it will affect bioacoustics on a global scale.},

   abstract = {Automated recorders and occupancy models can be used together to monitor population trends of multiple avian species across a large geographic region. Automated recorders are an attractive method for monitoring birds, because they leave a record that can be independently validated and multiple units can be programmed to repeatedly survey different locations at the same daily times. We assessed the use of automated recorders and single-species, single-season occupancy models to monitor common forest birds across a 5.4-million-ha region of northern California. Using a survey protocol of 5-minute recordings at 3 times of the morning repeated over 3 consecutive days at 453 sites, we detected 32 species at >10% of these sites. Five of these species (Steller's jay [Cyanocitta stelleri], mountain chickadee [Poecile gambeli], red-breasted nuthatch [Sitta canadensis], dark-eyed junco [Junco hyemalis], and western tanager [Piranga ludoviciana]) were dominant with occupancies >0.5. We also modeled occupancy associations with elevation and canopy cover for brown creeper (Certhia americana), MacGillivray's warbler (Geothlypis tolmiei), and western tanager and found the environmental conditions at which occupancy was maximized differed by up to 399m in elevation and 17.9% canopy cover for these species. Given a sampling effort of 100 new sites per year, we demonstrated 80% power (α=0.1) to detect occupancy declines as small as 2.5% per year over 20 years for the 32 most common species. The effective radius of automated recorder surveys was approximately 50m. In a field test, surveys conducted concurrently using automated recorders and point counts yielded similar occupancy estimates despite differences in detection probability. Our results suggest that automated recorders, used alone or in conjunction with point counts, can provide a practical means of monitoring common forest birds across a large geographic area.},

   abstract = {Presence or abundance of owls is frequently assessed using call-broadcast surveys to elicit responses and increase detection rates, but can draw owls in from a distance and could affect conclusions about fine-scale habitat associations. Passive acoustic surveys with field personnel or autonomous recording units (ARUs) may be a less biased method for surveying owls. Automated recognition techniques have proven useful to process large volumes of acoustic recordings from ARUs, and we sought to test the utility of automated recognition for three owl species. We built templates or "recognizers" for the territorial calls of the Barred Owl (Strix varia), the Boreal Owl (Aegolius funereus), and the Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus). We assessed the performance of each recognizer by evaluating precision, processing time, and false negatives. We used ARUs to survey for owls in northeastern Alberta, Canada, and compared the results from the recognizers to results from researchers listening to a subsample of the recordings. We verified the results to filter out false positives, but verification time was substantially lower than time spent listening. We processed more recordings and obtained a larger dataset of owl detections than would have been possible with either listening to the recordings only or conducting traditional field surveys without ARUs, suggesting a significant benefit of automated recognition. Precision was quite variable, but false negatives were relatively low and did not affect results of owl habitat associations. Given the relatively low detection rates of owls by listening to recordings, an automated recognition approach is likely to be highly useful for monitoring owls.},

   abstract = {The California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) is an older-forest associated species that resides at the center of forest management planning in the Sierra Nevada and Southern California, USA, which are experiencing increasingly large and severe wildfires and drought-related tree mortality. We leveraged advances in passive acoustic survey technologies to develop an acoustically assisted survey design that could increase the efficiency and effectiveness of project-level surveys for spotted owls, allowing surveys to be completed in a single year instead of in multiple years. We deployed an array of autonomous recording units (ARUs) across a landscape and identified spotted owl vocalizations in the resulting audio using BirdNET. We then evaluated spatio-temporal patterns in spotted owl vocalizations near occupied territories and the ability of a crew naïve to the location of occupied territories to locate spotted owls based on patterns of acoustic detections. After only 3 weeks of acoustic surveys, ≥1 ARU within 750 m of all 17 occupied territories obtained spotted owl detections across ≥2 nights. When active surveys using broadcast calling were conducted near ARUs with spotted owl detections by surveyors naïve to territory occupancy status and locations, surveyors located owls in 93% to 100% of occupied territories with ≤3 surveys. To further improve the efficiency of spotted owl surveys, we developed a statistical model to identify and prioritize areas across the Sierra Nevada for different survey methods (active only, acoustically assisted, no surveys) based on the expected probability of occupancy predicted from remotely sensed measurements of tree height and historical occupancy. Depending on managers' tolerance for false negatives, this model could help identify large areas that might not benefit from surveys based on low expected occupancy probabilities and areas where acoustically assisted surveys might enhance survey effectiveness and efficiency. Collectively, these findings can help managers streamline the survey process and thus increase the pace of forest restoration while minimizing potential near-term adverse effects on California spotted owls.},

   abstract = {Objective: The principal aim of this study was to assess the current prevalence rate of panic disorder (PD) in pregnant women during the third trimester of pregnancy. The second aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of PD in pregnant and nonpregnant women. Method: The study data were gathered from 512 consecutive women in the third trimester of pregnancy who were admitted to the obstetric outpatient clinics of 2 university research centers. The diagnosis of PD was determined by means of the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition Axis I disorders in the third trimester of pregnancy. Within the same period, the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale was used to determine the severity of PD. In addition, we compared the clinical characteristics of PD in gravid subjects (n = 13) with their control group. A control group was composed of 19 consecutive nonpregnant female outpatients diagnosed with PD who presented to the psychiatric outpatient clinics of the same hospitals. Results: The prevalence rate of PD was found to be 2.5% (n = 13) among the subjects in the third trimester of pregnancy. Of these 13 pregnant, 7 subjects reported that PD developed during the 6th to 28th weeks of their gestation, and the number of subjects who experienced PD symptoms before pregnancy was 6. In addition, there was no statistically difference between gravid and nongravid PD cases with regard to the severity of panic symptoms. Conclusion: Our study suggests that PD may be common among pregnant females during the third trimester of pregnancy and seems to be associated with similar clinical features during gestation and nongestation.

   abstract = {Retaining trees during harvesting to conserve biodiversity is becoming increasingly common in forestry. To assess, select and monitor these habitat trees, ecologists and practitioners often use Tree-related Microhabitats (TreMs), which are assumed to represent the abundance and diversity of environmental resources for a wide range of forest-dwelling taxa. However, the relationship between TreMs and forest organisms is not fully understood. In this context, we attempted to identify and quantify the links between TreMs and three groups of forest organisms: insects, bats, and birds. Specifically, we tested whether species abundance is influenced by TreM abundance, either as direct predictor or as mediator of environmental predictors. We collected data in 86 temperate, 1-ha mixed forest plots and employed a hierarchical generalized mixed model to assess the influence of seven environmental predictors (aspect, number and height of standing dead trees, cover of herb and shrub layer, volume of lying deadwood, and terrain ruggedness index (TRI)) on the abundance of TreMs (15 groups) on potential habitat trees, insects (10 orders), bats (5 acoustic groups) and birds (29 species) as a function of seven environmental predictors: aspect, number and height of standing dead trees, cover of herb and shrub layer, volume of lying deadwood, and terrain ruggedness index (TRI). This allowed us to generate a correlation matrix with potential links between abundances of TreMs and co-occurring forest organisms. These correlations and the environmental predictors were tested in a structural equation model (SEM) to disentangle and quantify the effects of the environment from direct effects of TreMs on forest organisms. Four TreM groups showed correlations > |0.30| with forest organisms, in particular with insects and bats. Rot holes and concavities were directly linked with three insect groups and two bat groups. Their effect was smaller than effects of environmental predictors, except for the pairs “rot holes – Sternorrhyncha” and “rot holes – bats” of the Pipistrellus group. In addition, TreMs had indirect effects on forest organisms through mediating the effects of environmental predictors. We found significant associations between two out of fifteen TreM groups and five out of 44 forest organism groups. These results indicate that TreM abundance on potential habitat trees is not suited as a general indicator of the species abundance across broad taxonomic groups but possibly for specific target groups with proven links.},

   abstract = {The conservation of biological diversity has become one of the important goals of managing forests in an ecologically sustainable way. Ecologists and forest resource managers need measures to judge the success or failure of management regimes designed to sustain biological diversity. The relationships between potential indicator species and total biodiversity are not well established. Carefully designed studies are required to test relationships between the presence and abundance of potential indicator species and other taxa and the maintenance of critical ecosystem processes in forests. Other indicators of biological diversity in forests, in addition or as alternatives to indicator species, include what we call structure-based indicators. These are stand-level and landscape-level (spatial) features of forests such as stand structural complexity and plant species composition, connectivity, and heterogeneity. Although the adoption of practices to sustain (or recreate) key characteristics of forest ecosystems appear intuitively sensible and broadly consistent with current knowledge, information is lacking to determine whether such stand- and landscape-level features of forests will serve as successful indices of (and help conserve) biodiversity. Given our limited knowledge of both indicator species and structure-based indicators, we advocate the following four approaches to enhance biodiversity conservation in forests: (1) establish biodiversity priority areas (e.g., reserves) managed primarily for the conservation of biological diversity; (2) within production forests, apply structure-based indicators including structural complexity, connectivity, and heterogeneity; (3) using multiple conservation strategies at multiple spatial scales, spread out risk in wood production forests; and (4) adopt an adaptive management approach to test the validity of structure-based indices of biological diversity by treating management practices as experiments. These approaches would aim to provide new knowledge to managers and improve the effectiveness of current management strategies.},

   abstract = {Since the introduction of retention forestry in the 1990s, its practice has spread in the boreal and temperate regions. Its benefits for biodiversity are well recognised, and usually presented in the form of aggregated results for each taxonomic group. However, ameliorating effects of increased levels of retention on species with different ecological requirements is still not well studied. With this meta-analysis, we aim at disentangling the response of different bird guilds, considering the level of retention applied, as well as other confounding factors, such as the forest type or harvested area. We used a systematic review protocol and collected 30 studies which compared the response of birds to a gradient of retention levels against unharvested forests and/or clearcuts. Firstly, we compared the overall response of the full bird assemblage to retention, and found no differences in abundance and species richness between retention and unharvested forest, except for the abundance of some forest specialist species. Secondly, assessing the responses of various guilds showed that each bird guild can be affected very differently, according to their life history, biome, forest type and, most importantly, retention intensity. Results allow us to infer minimum retention levels needed to preserve each bird guild, admitting that other factors can play an important role in shaping the bird assemblage, often in interaction with retention. For example, canopy and cavity nesters showed a more positive response to lower levels of retention in mixed or broadleaved forests than in conifer forests. Our results indicate that minimum retention levels ranging between 40 and 60% of original habitat are needed, in order to maintain the same bird assemblage as in the autochthonous unharvested forest, with particular regard to the forest specialists.},

This technique has several advantages and addresses many of the biases related to traditional field surveys. However, locating animal sounds using autonomous recording units (ARUs) can be technically challenging and therefore ARUs have traditionally been little employed to estimate animal density. Nonetheless, several approaches have been proposed in recent years to carry out acoustic-based bird density estimations. We conducted a literature review of studies that used ARUs for estimating bird densities or bird abundances in order to describe the applications and improve future monitoring programmes. We detected a growing interest in the use of ARUs for estimating bird density in the last 6 years (2014–19), with a total of 31 articles assessing the topic. The most common approach was to estimate the relationship between the number of vocalizations per recording time with bird density or bird abundance estimated in the field (61%). In 26 studies (79%), bird estimates obtained by human surveyors agreed with those obtained using ARUs. Some approaches have proven able to reduce biases in acoustic surveys, such as considering imperfect detection (spatially explicit capture–recapture, using microphone arrays), applying paired acoustic sampling to control for different sampling radius between humans and ARUs, or including relative sound level measurements that allow researchers to estimate bird distance to recorder. However, several studies did not include any covariates to reduce existing biases and some did not estimate the sampling radius of the recorder, which may hamper future comparisons between human and ARU surveys. Future studies should include a measurement of the sampling radius of the recorder employed to be able to obtain density estimations using ARUs. Finally, we provide some guidelines to improve the applicability of ARUs to infer bird population estimates in future studies.},

   abstract = {Manually annotating audio files for bird species richness estimation or machine learning validation is a time-intensive task. A premium is placed on the subselection of files that will maximize the efficiency of unique additional species identified, to be used for future analyses. Using acoustic data collected in 17 plots, we created 60 subsetting scenarios across three gradients: intensity (minutes in an hour), day phase (dawn, morning, or both), and duration (number of days) for manual annotation. We analyzed the effect of these variables on observed bird species richness and assemblage composition at both the local and entire study area scale. For reference, results were also compared to richness and composition estimated by the traditional point count method. Intensity, day phase, and duration all affected observed richness in decreasing respective order. These variables also significantly affected observed assemblage composition (in the same order of effect size), but only the day phase produced compositional dissimilarity that was due to phenological traits of individual bird species, rather than differences in species richness. All annotation scenarios requiring equal sampling effort to point counts yielded higher species richness than the point count method. Our results show that a great majority of species can be obtained by annotating files at high sampling intensities (every 3 or 6 min) in the morning period (post-dawn) over a duration of two days. Depending on a study's aim, different subsetting parameters will produce different assemblage compositions, potentially omitting rare or crepuscular species, species representing additional functional groups and natural history guilds, or species of higher conservation concern. We do not recommend one particular subsetting regime for all research objectives, but rather present multiple scenarios for researchers to understand how intensity, day phase, and duration interact to identify the best subsetting regime for one's particular research interests.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Forests managed for timber production can also be managed for biodiversity conservation by retaining structures typical of old-growth forests, which provide heterogenous structures for forest-dwelling species, including birds. Ecoacoustic monitoring of forest birds is now a well-studied field, however the extent to which acoustic indices can reflect bird assemblage responses to stands of lower or higher structural heterogeneity is disputed. Method: In this study, we acoustically surveyed 75 plots over two years in mature, previously managed forests and computed acoustic indices from the recordings. We first identified an acoustic index that significantly correlated with bird richness over more than one spring season. Next, we tested the response of bird richness to individual forest structural elements using linear regressions. We then repeated this analysis but combined the individual structural elements into one structural composition variable using an NMDS and gam smooth overlay, to compare the effect of individual forest structures versus overall forest heterogeneity on bird richness. We then repeated this analysis using our selected acoustic index, the Normalized Difference Soundscape Index (NDSI), to see if it followed the same patterns as bird richness in response to individual and collective forest structural elements. Results: Our results showed that plots with high bird richness were also associated with high NDSI values, and high values of both variables occurred in plots with high structural heterogeneity (tree species richness, tree size variability, and snag height variability) and low amounts of standing and lying deadwood. Discussion: Our findings suggest that once an acoustic index can be identified as a robust correlate of bird richness, it can serve as a proxy for the response of birds to differences in forest structural heterogeneity within a managed forest context. It is therefore possible for forest managers interested in conserving or increasing bird richness in their production forests to identify a robust acoustic index to track the response of bird richness to management decisions over time.},

   abstract = {Retention forestry, which retains a portion of the original stand at the time of harvesting to maintain continuity of structural and compositional diversity, has been originally developed to mitigate the impacts of clear-cutting. Retention of habitat trees and deadwood has since become common practice also in continuous-cover forests of Central Europe. While the use of retention in these forests is plausible, the evidence base for its application is lacking, trade-offs have not been quantified, it is not clear what support it receives from forest owners and other stakeholders and how it is best integrated into forest management practices. The Research Training Group ConFoBi (Conservation of Forest Biodiversity in Multiple-use Landscapes of Central Europe) focusses on the effectiveness of retention forestry, combining ecological studies on forest biodiversity with social and economic studies of biodiversity conservation across multiple spatial scales. The aim of ConFoBi is to assess whether and how structural retention measures are appropriate for the conservation of forest biodiversity in uneven-aged and selectively harvested continuous-cover forests of temperate Europe. The study design is based on a pool of 135 plots (1 ha) distributed along gradients of forest connectivity and structure. The main objectives are (a) to investigate the effects of structural elements and landscape context on multiple taxa, including different trophic and functional groups, to evaluate the effectiveness of retention practices for biodiversity conservation; (b) to analyze how forest biodiversity conservation is perceived and practiced, and what costs and benefits it creates; and (c) to identify how biodiversity conservation can be effectively integrated in multi-functional forest management. ConFoBi will quantify retention levels required across the landscape, as well as the socio-economic prerequisites for their implementation by forest owners and managers. ConFoBi's research results will provide an evidence base for integrating biodiversity conservation into forest management in temperate forests.},

   abstract = {Birds of prey have been, in comparison to other avian groups, an uncommon study model, mainly due to the limitations imposed by their conservative life strategy (low population density and turnover). Nonetheless, they have attracted a strong interest from the point of view of conservation biology because many populations have been close to extinction and because of their recognised role in ecosystems as top predators and scavengers and as flagship species. Today, after more than a century of persecution, and with the exception of some vultures still very much affected by illegal poisoning, many populations of birds of prey have experienced significant recoveries in many regions of Spain and the European Mediterranean. These changes pose new challenges when addressing the conservation of raptors in the coming decades. On this basis, and from a preferentially Mediterranean perspective, we have focused our attention on the need of describing and quantifying the role of these birds as providers of both regulating (rodent pest control and removal of livestock carcasses) and cultural ecosystem services. Moreover, we revisited persisting conflicts with human interests (predation of game species) and call attention to the emergence of new conflicts with a strong social and media component such as the predation on live cattle by vultures. Also, the rampant humanization of the environment determines the need for new solutions to the growing, yet scarcely explored, problem of accidents in new infrastructures such as mortality in wind farms. Finally, we explored in depth the ecological response of birds of prey to large-scale habitat changes such as urbanisation and abandonment of marginal lands that are also expected to increase in the near future. We urgently need more scientific knowledge to provide adequate responses to the challenge of keeping healthy populations of avian predators and scavengers in a rapidly changing world.},

   abstract = {Resident birds in boreal forests can serve as indicators of habitat quality and are often species of conservation interest, particularly in multifunctional forests also used for timber production. To make informed forest management decisions, we must first understand which structural features provide habitats useful for resident birds. This is particularly true in winter, an understudied and critical season for their survival. The objective of this study was to establish reliable methods for monitoring bird presence and activity during winter, and to use these methods to evaluate the relative importance of stand structural features to make inferences about which features support and increase winter survival potential. Using a hybrid bioacoustic and ecoacoustic approach, we tested the ability of acoustic recordings to identify links between bird diversity and components of structural complexity, and compared these results to those from the traditional point count method. We conducted a vegetation survey, point count surveys and collected acoustic recordings from December 2019–February 2020 in 19 sites in a Swedish boreal forest. First, we compared species richness values derived from point counts and bioacoustic monitoring methods. Bioacoustic species richness was significantly higher than point count richness, although only when the time spent identifying species from recordings exceeded the time spent conducting point counts in the field. Next, we demonstrated that bioacoustic species identification yields additional metrics of bird activity that point counts cannot. We tested the response of these metrics, and point count metrics, to variables of structural heterogeneity and complexity of our sites. Almost all bioacoustic metrics increased significantly with increasing structural complexity, while point count richness and abundance did not, indicating that automated recording is more effective in identifying forest patches of high quality in winter. Lastly, using an ecoacoustic approach, we calculated six of the most common acoustic indices and tested if any could effectively reflect the bird-structure relationships described above. Two indices showed significant positive relationships to bioacoustic metrics, demonstrating their potential as biodiversity assessment proxies that respond to differences in habitat quality. This is the first winter acoustic study to monitor bird assemblages in detail; it employed both bioacoustic and multi-index ecoacoustic approaches, which provided evidence that automated acoustic recording can be an effective and superior method for monitoring resident forest birds.},

   abstract = {Forest bird abundance in Europe has remained stable overall, unlike farmland species which have declined dramatically in recent decades. However, this apparent stability may hide large variations among species and geographical regions. We aimed to determine if forest bird species with varying life histories and biome distributions show different population trends. We used functional traits and specialisation indices to study changes in abundance and distribution of European forest bird populations. For each species, we used European-level estimates of total abundance change over the last 40 years and changes in two components of spatial distribution: range change (i.e. area shrinkage or expansion) and distribution shift (i.e. latitudinal adjustments), both over the last 30 years. We also considered specialist groups of different biomes (i.e. boreal, temperate, Mediterranean and biome generalists) separately. We showed that boreal forest species have declined in abundance and range area, while Mediterranean and temperate species have increased in abundance and range, possibly as the result of warmer temperatures and forest expansion in these regions. The decline of boreal forest species may result from changes in forest structure and composition due to forestry practices, increasing temperatures and colonisation by warm-dwelling species. Among boreal species, mixed forest specialists (i.e. those preferring a mix of broadleaf and coniferous trees) declined the most in abundance and range and shifted northwards. In contrast, for vertebrate carnivores (i.e. birds of prey), we observed an increase in abundance among Mediterranean species and a southward expansion among all species. Our findings suggest that forest bird species in Europe may be influenced by the combined effects of land use and climate change, with these impacts varying across biomes. Our results highlight the need for maintaining and restoring key forest habitats (e.g. through increased protected areas and extensive management) and halting or limiting climate change, especially for boreal species.},

   abstract = {Effective monitoring of rare and declining species is critical to enable their conservation, but can often be difficult due to detectability or survey constraints. However, developments in acoustic recorders are enabling an important new approach for improved monitoring that is especially applicable for long-term studies, and for use in difficult environments or with cryptic species. Bioacoustic data may be effectively analysed within an occupancy modelling framework, as presence/absence can be determined, and repeated survey events can be accommodated. Hence, both occupancy and detectability estimates can be produced from large, coherent datasets. However, the most effective methods for the practical detection and identification of call data are still far from established. We assessed a novel combination of automated clustering and manual verification to detect and identify heathland bird vocalizations, covering a period of six days at 44 sampling locations. Occupancy (Ψ) and detectability (p) were modelled for each species, and the best fit models provided values of: nightjar Ψ = 0.684, p = 0.740, Dartford warbler Ψ = 0.449, p = 0.196 and woodlark Ψ = 0.13, p = 0.996. Including environmental covariates within the occupancy models indicated that tree, wetland and heather cover were important variables, particularly influencing detectability. The protocol used here allowed robust and consistent survey data to be gathered, with limited fieldwork resourcing, allowing population estimates to be generated for the target bird species. The combination of bioacoustics and occupancy modelling can provide a valuable new monitoring approach, allowing population trends to be identified, and the effects of environmental change and site management to be assessed.},

   abstract = {Stemming from a pervasive lack of knowledge on biodiversity, important areas for conservation are typically identified using a subset of well known species, commonly termed surrogate or indicator groups. Birds have been commonly used as biodiversity surrogates due to the good level of knowledge on their taxonomy, ecology and distribution. Raptors in particular have been often proposed as an effective surrogate for other biodiversity based on their dietary diversity, being at the top of the food chain, their preference for highly productive areas, their generally threatened status and high public appeal. However, so far the surrogacy effectiveness of raptors has been largely studied locally or using a narrow selection of surrogate and surrogated taxa. Here we use a spatial conservation planning tool to quantify the surrogacy performance of raptors, overall and by different raptor groups (hawks and eagles, falcons, vultures, owls) to represent important biodiversity areas (such as IUCN protected areas and key biodiversity areas), wilderness areas and the worlds ecoregions. We compared the above surrogacy performance with that of all other non-raptor avian species. We show that raptors perform marginally worse than all other avian species in representing important biodiversity areas and ecoregions. However, raptors representation for wilderness areas was similar or slightly better compared to that of using all non-raptor birds. We also report a large variation in the representation performance by the four raptor groups. Falcons had a particularly high potential in representing protected areas and wilderness areas, equaling or largely surpassing the representation potential provided by all raptors and all other non-raptor birds. Overall, the results suggest that raptors, and particularly falcons, can perform relatively well in representing some important areas for conservation, such as protected areas and wilderness areas, but are relatively poor surrogates for key biodiversity areas and ecoregions. These rather contrasting results call for caution on the use of raptors as global surrogates of wider biodiversity.},
